:title-page: Atlas RISC-V Functional Model

== Introduction

Atlas is an open-source RISC-V functional model built using the Sparta modeling framework.

== Actions and Action Groups

The Atlas functional model is driven by executing series of Actions collected into groups called
Action Groups. An Action is a functor that represents an independent portion of work that is
executed by Atlas, like decoding an opcode or writing to an instruction log. Breaking up the Atlas
engine into Actions allows the model to modularly modify itself to run more efficiently.

TODO: How to execute an ActionGroup

TODO: How to loop through a series of connected ActionGroups

== Atlas Core

Atlas's core engine is comprised of 7 Action Groups:

[options="header"]
|==========================================================================================================
| Action Group | Class | Function
| Fetch | Fetch | Requests address translation for the current PC
| Instruction Translation | Translation | Translates virtual addresses of instructions
| Decode | Fetch | Reads opcodes from memory and decodes them using Mavis
| Execute | Execute | Assembles the current instruction's Action Group
| Data Translation | Translate | Translates virtual addresses of data for instructions that access memory
| Exception | Exception | Handles exceptions
| Finish | Atlas State | Updates the program and simulator state after an instruction is finished executing
