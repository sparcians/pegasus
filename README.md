## Install Prerequisites

Install the following packages (tested with Ubuntu 24.04):

- (apt-get install cmake) cmake v3.22
- (apt-get install clang) Clang, Version: 14.0.0
- (apt-get install libboost-all-dev) boost 1.74.0
- (apt-get install libyaml-cpp-dev) YAML CPP 0.7.0
- (apt-get install rapidjson-dev) RapidJSON CPP 1.1.0
- (apt-get install libsqlite3-dev) SQLite3 3.37.2
- (apt-get install libhdf5-dev) HDF5 1.10.7

An Pegasus Conda environment is also available:
```
conda env create -f conda/pegasus_env.yaml
conda activate pegasus
```

## Install Sparta
Download and build sparta, map_v2:
```
git clone git@github.com:sparcians/map
cd map/sparta
mkdir release
cd release
CC=$COMPILER CXX=$CXX_COMPILER cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr/local/
sudo make -j$(nproc --all) install
```

If using Conda, you must install Sparta in the Pegasus Conda environment:
```
cmake --install . --prefix $CONDA_PREFIX
```


## Clone Pegasus and Build/Regress
```
git clone --recursive git@github.com:sparcians/pegasus.git
cd pegasus
mkdir release
cd release
cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DSPARTA_SEARCH_DIR=/usr/local
make
make pegasus_regress
```
Alternatively, you can build Pegasus without an install of Sparta by providing a path
to your Sparta repo and Pegasus will build the Sparta library for
you. Since Sparta already has a make target named `regress`, the Pegasus
regression make target is renamed to `pegasus_regress`.

```
mkdir release
cd release
cmake .. -CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DSPARTA_SEARCH_DIR=<full path to map/sparta>
make
make pegasus_regress
```

## Validate
### RISC-V Unit Tests
The RISC-V unit tests ([riscv-software-src/riscv-tests](https://github.com/riscv-software-src/riscv-tests))
are a set of self-checking unit tests provided by the RISC-V Foundation. Follow the directions in
the [README](https://github.com/riscv-software-src/riscv-tests#readme) to build the tests.

```
cd pegasus/<build>/sim
python ../../scripts/RunArchTest.py --riscv-arch $RISCV_TESTS_PATH/isa/
```

### Tenstorrent
The Tenstorrent architectural tests ([tenstorrent/riscv_arch_tests](https://github.com/tenstorrent/riscv_arch_tests))
are a set of self-checking architectural tests provided by Tenstorrent. Follow the directions in the
[README](https://github.com/riscv-software-src/riscv-tests?tab=readme-ov-file#building-from-repository)
to build the tests. Alternatively, pre-built tests can be downloaded here: [Releases/v0.2.0+aligned-access](https://github.com/tenstorrent/riscv_arch_tests/releases/tag/v0.2.0%2Baligned-access)
```
cd pegasus/<build>/sim
python ../../scripts/RunArchTest.py --tenstorrent $TENSTORRENT_TESTS_PATH/bare_metal/user/
```

## Debug

To build Pegasus for debugging, Debug and FastDebug build types are available.
```
CC=clang CXX=clang++ cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=FastDebug
```
```
CC=clang CXX=clang++ cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug
```
